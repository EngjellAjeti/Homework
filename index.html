                    Tiramisu (Italian: tiramisù [ˌtiramiˈsu], from tirami su, "pick me up" or "cheer me up")[1] is a coffee-flavoured Italian dessert. It is made of ladyfingers (savoiardi) dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar, and mascarpone cheese, flavoured with cocoa. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts.[2] Its origins are often disputed among Italian regions Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia.                </p>

      <br> <strong> Tiramisu appears </strong> to have been invented in the 1960s or 1970s, but where and when exactly is unclear.[3]

        Recipes named "tiramisu" are unknown in cookbooks before the 1960s. The word appears in print in Italian in 1980,[4] and in English in 1982.[5][6]
        
        Some accounts of the origin of tiramisu date its invention to the 1960s in the region of Veneto, Italy, at the restaurant "Le Beccherie" in Treviso. Specifically, the dish is claimed to have first been created by a confectioner named Roberto Linguanotto, owner of "Le Beccherie".[7][8] Le Beccherie is supposed to have invented it on 24 December 1969.[9][10][11][12] It is sometimes claimed that tiramisu has aphrodisiac effects and was served in brothels in Treviso.[13]
        
        Others claim it was created towards the end of the 17th century in Siena in honour of Grand Duke Cosimo III.[14]
        
        There is also evidence of a "Tiremesù" semi-frozen dessert served by the Vetturino restaurant in Pieris, in the Friuli Venezia Giulia, since 1938.[15] This may be the name's origin, while the recipe for Tiramisu may have originated as a variation of another layered dessert, Zuppa Inglese.[16]
        
        It is mentioned in a 1983 cookbook devoted to cooking of the Veneto.[17]
        
        Tiramisu is similar to other desserts, in particular with the Charlotte, in some versions composed of a Bavarian cream surrounded by a crown of ladyfingers and covered by a sweet cream; the Turin cake (dolce Torino), consisting of ladyfingers soaked in rosolio and alchermes with a spread made of butter, egg yolks, sugar, milk, and dark chocolate; and the Bavarese Lombarda, which is a similar composition of ladyfingers and egg yolks (albeit cooked ones). In Bavarese, butter and rosolio (or alchermes) are also used, but not mascarpone cream nor coffee.[citation needed]
        
        Interest in tiramisu in the United States increased in 1993 when Tom Hanks' protagonist in the comedy Sleepless in Seattle heard of it only as a mysterious thing that modern women loved.[18]
        
        On July 29, 2017, Tiramisu was entered by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies on the list of traditional Friulian and Giulian agri-food products in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region</p>

                Another variation involves the preparation of the cream with eggs heated to sterilize it, but not so much that the eggs scramble. Over time, replacing some of the ingredients, mainly coffee, there arose numerous variants such as tiramisu with chocolate, amaretto, berry, lemon, strawberry, pineapple, yogurt, banana, raspberry, and coconut. These are however not considered true Tiramisu as these variations only share the layered characteristic of Tiramisu; these examples more closely resemble variations of trifle.

            <p>Numerous variations of Tiramisu exist. Some cooks use other cakes or sweet, yeasted breads, such as panettone, in place of ladyfingers (savoiardi).[21] Bakers living in different Italian regions often debate the use and structural qualities of utilising other types of cookies, such as pavesini for instance, in the recipe.[22] Other cheese mixtures are used as well, some containing raw eggs, and others containing no eggs at all. Marsala wine can be added to the recipe, but other liquors are frequently substituted for it in both the coffee and the cheese mixture, including dark rum, Madeira, port, brandy, Malibu, or Irish cream and especially coffee-flavoured liqueurs such as Tia Maria and Kahlúa.[23] Disaronno is also often used to enhance the taste of tiramisu.</p>

                        In Spain it is a traditional Christmas dessert (mazapán), although in Toledo, where the first written reference of this product dates back to 1512, it is eaten all year round. In Italy, particularly in Palermo, marzipan (marzapane) is often shaped and painted with food colourings to resemble fruit—Frutta martorana—especially during the Christmas season and on Il Giorno dei Morti (All Souls' Day) on November 2. May 9 and 10 are also special days for eating marzipan in Sicily.[2] In Portugal, where the confection has been traditionally made by nuns,[3] marzipan (maçapão) is used to make fruit-shaped sweets; in the Algarve region in particular it is a very common sweet. There are other regions, as Toledo in Spain in which marzipan (mazapán) is shaped into simple animal shapes, and sometimes filled in with egg yolk (yema) and sugar. In Greece and Cyprus, marzipan is made in a variety of shapes and sizes and is almost always left white.[citation needed] In the islands of the Aegean in particular, white marzipan is considered a wedding treat and is served to guests at wedding feasts.[citation needed] In Malta marzipan is used as a filling in the traditional Maltese Easter treats called Figolla.

                        In Belgium and the Netherlands, marzipan figures are given as Saint Nicholas's presents. In Germany, it is common to give marzipan in the shape of a loaf of bread, which is called "Marzipanbrot", during Christmas time or shaped as small potatoes (Marzipankartoffeln). Besides Stollen, marzipan is often featured as an ingredient in seasonal baked goods, such as Bethmännchen and other Christmas cookies. One traditional new year present is known as a Glücksschwein ('lucky pig'). Mozartkugel from Austria are a famed export made of marzipan balls dipped in dark chocolate. Stollen can contain marzipan.

In the United Kingdom, celebratory fruitcakes are decorated with a layer of marzipan- particularly Christmas cake which is covered with white sugar icing, and at Easter the Simnel cake contains a layer of marzipan, a further layer decorates the top and 12 spheres symbolise the apostles of Christ- the marzipan is lightly grilled or toasted to colour it. Battenberg cake, which originates in England, is covered in a layer of marzipan.[4] In Geneva, a traditional part of the celebration of L'Escalade is the ritual smashing of a chocolate cauldron filled with marzipan vegetables, a reference to a Savoyard siege of the city which was supposedly foiled by a housewife with a cauldron of boiling soup.[citation needed] </dd>

In Tallinn, in Maiasmokk café, there is a small museum dedicated to the history and manufacture of marzipan.[10]  </dd>

Marzipan can also be made from oatmeal, farina, or semolina.[11] For Jews in Iran, marzipan fruit is a traditional Passover treat, replacing biscuits and cakes. </dd>
